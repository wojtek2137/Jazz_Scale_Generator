# Jazz_Scale_Generator

This is the app I am most proud of, but it has also taken me the most time. I decided to do something that will result from the merger of the two worlds that I deal with.
So I used my academic music knowledge and programming skills so I was able to create an algorithm that generates a scale in each musical key, only with a numerical recipe for a given scale stored in an one and only one array of numbers.
This algorithm is so universal that it allows me to easily add new scales thanks to one short array.
To write what my algorithm generates, I used Vexflow JS , which was created for MANUAL music notation. Phew, it took me a long time to make working colaboration of my algorithm and VexFlow JS... but in the end THAT'S WORKING!
I am going to add many more scales in the future and I think it could be a great program to learn jazz harmony for students of this very difficult music.
